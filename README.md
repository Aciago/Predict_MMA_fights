### :muscle: Learning goals:
- working with large datasets
- exploring, cleaning and manipulating dataset according to our objectives
- building Machine Learning algorithms
- building an applicable product using ML

### :briefcase: Scenario:
Sports betting is a multibillion dollar industry. Its popularity both in regional and global market makes it a very attractive business. Fighting ranks among the top in the industry. We would like to build a model that will allow us to predict the outcome of MMA fights, based on historical data. Ideal outcome is a model that can both predict the winner and give high enough probability (>65-70%) for this outcome. This way we could also leverage risk factors when deciding to bet according to the model or against it.

### :package: Dataset:
Our dataset is originally from Kaggle.
